Version 1.4
Software Raspberry.
Major updates
- Changes for Raspberry Pi 2 and for new Raspbian release 
  - Automatically I2C enabled (by script)
  - New wiringPi release (compatible with Raspberry pi 2)
  - Tomcat Java link correction 
    If you have to change link, edit file: /etc/profile.d/setvar.sh

- New HTML Raspberry console (Shellinabox)
  Shellinabox starts as demon and uses SSL (HTTPS) by default.
  If you want change its behaviour you can use the utility: 
    /home/pi/RandAutil/WConsoleSetSSL.sh  with argument SSL or NOSSL
  Certificate is automatically generated and is: /var/lib/shellinabox/certificate.pem  

- RandA web application is now protected by login:  user randa and psw. randa by default.
  If you want disable protection you have to edit file:
    /home/apache-tomcat-7.0.47/webapps/RandA/WEB-INF/web.xml
  But if you want just change user/psw you have to edit file:
    /home/apache-tomcat-7.0.47/conf/tomcat-users.xml
  Furthermore, RandA web application too, uses secure protocol (HTTPS) by default.
  But you can change its behaviour using the utility:
    /home/pi/RandAutil/WRandASetSSL.sh  with argument SSL or NOSSL
  Certificate is generated automatically in installation phase by the script:
    /home/pi/RandAutil/CreaWebSSLCertificate.sh
  and the file is : /home/pi/.keystore     

Please note that SSL certificate is private (not validated by international org.).
So, browsers show warning. Don't care and continue.
But you can tell your browser to locally register certificate as valid certificate.
Or, if you like, you can ask to int. org. for validation.   

Installation archive (RandAinstall.tar.gz) now contains the complete Arduino 
for Linux package and other important packages. So, you can install RandA 
software without Internet. At the end of installation, the procedure (RandAinstall.sh)
asks for downloading and installing Codeblocks (C++ IDE) and Eclipse (Java IDE).
Package self contained and installed:
- wiringPi : crucial for RandA operation
- tomcat (as directory not package)(it uses Java): web server with applications 
- shellinabox : web console
- pi4j : java version of wiringPi (just for convenience) 
- arduino : for local sketches developping (local option for sketches developping)
External packages (optional)(require Internet)
- codeblocks : C++ IDE (recommended)
- eclipse : Java IDE (useful if Raspberry Pi 2)(otherwise it is too slow)
IMPORTANT: please note that eclipse from Debian installs Java 6; to restore Java 8 use the
utility  "/home/pi/RandAutil/java8ResetLink.sh"

- correct uploading process. Now sketch is uploaded at first attempt (always). 
  (Bug on previous installation procedure: modified /boot/cmdline.txt had comment and 
   serial port could be shared with Linux kernel)           

Minor updates
- new command "explorer" with argument -r opens file management window with
  root privileges. 
  (Because the new pcmanfm program no more has the "root opening window" menu item)

- new commands: GetSketchName and SketchVerify
  Both work only if sketch implements itsMe() function (replying with name to ? )   

- better version of ArduIO and ArduInt (commands to manage Arduino I/O from Raspberry)
  If appropriate sketch is not inside it will be uploaded.

- New command "startgui" to start Raspberry desktop (in X environment like MobaXterm)

- Arduino I/O web page now automatically uploads SerialIO sketch if is not inside. 
  So, now, when you open serial communication, are ready to operate.
  
Software PC (Arduino IDE)

- Modified detecting remote port: now the file "remoteport.properties" contains 
  timeout setting. So, it is possible to increase timeout if local network is big
  or decrease if small.
