RandA software distribution.

Two software for two environments.
- A zip file for PC. Extract directory (anywhere) on PC and read README.TXT file
  included.
- A zip file for Raspberry. You can copy this file to Raspberry and unzip it 
  there, or you can unzip locally and copy archive and installation script later.
  Read the InstallationREADME.TXT file included.
  
An handbook with a complete description of RandA (RandA-en.pdf) is included.    

N.B. A copy of PC archive and documentation is also contained in archive for 
Raspberry and extracted to /home/pi/RandA directory for backup. 

These procedures for upgrading your Raspbian OS, already installed, and for upgrading
Arduino IDE, are the shortest software to download (single zip file of about 20M).
But, if you like, you can use a complete Raspbian image (with RandA software)
to download and install, on your SD card.
And you can download, also, the entire Arduino IDE modified.
Using these longer downloads, you are directly operating, without installation
procedure. But you lose your already installed software (if any) and you need to 
install it again.
